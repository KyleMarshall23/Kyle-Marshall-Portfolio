### Spotify Playlist Compiler 🎧
**Role:** Full-Stack Developer  
**Description:** The Spotify Playlist Compiler is a personal passion project that showcases my love for music and technical problem-solving. This tool automates the process of compiling a year-end playlist from my 12 monthly Spotify playlists, ordered from best to worst. 

- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** The project leverages stack data structures to manage and display Spotify song objects, including album art, titles, and artists for the 12 most recent monthly playlists.
- **UI Design:** The interface allows for an intuitive selection process, enabling users to preview their compiled playlist before finalizing it.
- **Spotify API Integration:** Through seamless integration with the Spotify API, the tool handles authentication, session management, and playlist creation, navigating users to their newly created playlist with a simple click.
- **Real-World Application:** This project provided me with hands-on experience in handling OAuth tokens, session management, and working with RESTful APIs, all while ensuring a smooth and user-friendly interface.
